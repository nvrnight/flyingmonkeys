flyingmonkeys
=============
Currently only supports the Ubuntu family.

sudo apt-get install -y python-tk

./flyingmonkeys.py

Pull requests appreciated. I would like to support more OSes and have the application build the UI using a configuration file so more types of development could be supported without getting in the way of other development types(IE web stuff vs desktop application stuff). Thanks!
